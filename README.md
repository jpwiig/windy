check if it is windy in your norwegian municipality or not! 

**Just so you know:** It is meant to be a gaffateip solution.

Using [kartverkets API](https://ws.geonorge.no/kommuneinfo/v1/#/default/get_sok) to find coordinates, to then send to use the lattitude and longitude in the [yrs api](https://developer.yr.no/) to find the wind. 

you are welcome to open a issue, i will check it out.

*All apis used is open to everyone, i do not own the data*
